## Project Background

This repository is the combined work of a group of five students during the second semester of the Software Design course.
We were given the ATM code from [DanH957](https://github.com/DanH957/ATM-Machine) and various tasks like fixing errors, implementing features and writing documentation.


## New Code and Documentation

After carefully looking into the old ATM code, we decided to completely rewrite the program.
Using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) we managed to automatically generate a website from markdown files with GitHub Actions.

## Libraries

- gson-2.9.0.jar
- hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
- junit-4.13.2.jar
